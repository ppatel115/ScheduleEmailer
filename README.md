# ScheduleEmailer
Email me my daily class times and locations, so I have an easy way to check them (because the UF app doesn't do this well anymore)

## Usage
Initialize fromaddr with your gmail email address
Initialize toaddr with the email address you want the alert sent to
Initialize password with your gmail password (I recommend creating an app password for this program that you can use instead <https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en>)
Add the images you want to send yourself to the same directory as ScheduleEmailer.py, and change the filenames (lines 35, 60, and 85) and paths (lines 36, 61, and 86) accordingly
Change the class times (lines 10-12) according to your schedule

### If you plan on running it locally and setting your own schedule
Uncomment the commented code or add your own code to schedule when the job runs
